# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a browser version of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, a game where you are playing 9 games of Tic-Tac-Toe, at the same time...

This version features autosaving, 1 player or local 2 player play, custom settings and themes, and two game modes (normal mode and conquest mode). LocalStorage use is required to save the game.

I initially created this game in 2020 with basic coding knowledge. I updated this code later in 2021 as part of The Odin Project curriculum to include modular javascript.
